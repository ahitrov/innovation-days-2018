Narrator:

We call it THE IMDB USER REVIEW MOVIE SCORE EXTRACTOR, URMSE for short, and is an integral part of the entry for every movie. And we have entries for all the movies! Ever! (IMDB site scene (A))

Once a user has created a new review the USER REVIEW MOVIE SCORE EXTRACTOR would analyse the review and through the power of Machine Learning would extract an honest score based on the review's sentiment (create review scene (B)).
